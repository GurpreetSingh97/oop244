1.The operator+ should return a Fraction object and not a reference to it, because
the object is defined only in the curly brackets of the operator. We cannot return
its reference as it is not defined out-side of the operator.
2.The Fraction obj in the query operators is the temperorary object in this tester
module.
3.The simplification that I added to the class without affecting the interface to
the client code is by adding some private functions in my class, that cannot be 
accessed by the user but this function affect the properties of the object.
4.From this workshop I learned how to create query and modifier operator overload.
