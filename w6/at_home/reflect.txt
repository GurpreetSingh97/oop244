1.The copy constructor assignment operator checks for self assignment before doing
 anything else because in the implementation we are deallocating the memory of the
 pointer, if both, the source and destination object are same, then all the
 data from the pointer will be lost and there will be an error.

2.By observing that which part of the code is coming into use again and again
 and finally converting it into a private function helps in avaoiding the 
 duplication.

3.From this workshop I learned how to make and deal with copy constructors and
 copy assignment operators. Moreover, I get to know dynamic memory and constructors 
 in a better manner.



QUIZ:
In the last Quiz which comprises the decleration of copy assignment operators and
copy constructors, my score was 9/10.
